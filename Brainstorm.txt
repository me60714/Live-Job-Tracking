Goal: to build an automatic live job tracking line graph.

Background: 
Currently we use the Jira free version to help us track all the jobs.

Process of a job:
    1. Sample Prepare:
        a. Receive a  job (or a sample, a task)
        b. Create job number
        c. Taking photos
        d. Measure wall thickness
        e. Specimens cutting
        f. Specimens machining
    2.Testing

What it should look like:
    1. A line graph
    2. Different colors for different stages
    3. Be able to select different time range
    4. Be able to select different stages
    5. Be able to filter out the issues that are not in the selected stages
    6. Be able to show the total number of issues in each stage
    7. Automatically update every 3 minutes
    8. It should present in a popup window, and people can click on it to see the details, filter the data and see those visualization charts.


for each TOP LEVEL ISSUE in the JIRA, we call it a "job"
